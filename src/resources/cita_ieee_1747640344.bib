  abstract = {Enhancing software quality and reducing testing expenses requires better software fault detection. To guarantee the dependability and usability of software, Software Defect Prediction (SDP) uses machine learning approaches to anticipate and address any problems early in the development cycle. Numerous machine learning techniques, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Stump, J48, Lazy IBK, and ZeroR, are thoroughly examined in this work. With an emphasis on feature selection as a crucial step in increasing prediction accuracy and lower computing costs, these approaches are assessed for their capacity to detect software flaws precisely. This research study demonstrates how these models may improve fault identification and prevention procedures using historical records from sources such as the PROMISE repository. The study highlights the best practices for machine learning-based software quality assurance, lowering expenses while guaranteeing superior results.},
