  abstract = {Fashion is the way we present ourselves which mainly focuses on vision, has attracted great interest from computer vision researchers. It is generally used to search fashion products in online shopping malls to know the descriptive information of the product. The main objectives of our paper is to use deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods to correctly identify and categorize clothing images. In this work, we used ML algorithms (support vector machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neirghbors (KNN), Decision tree (DT), Random Forest (RF)), DL algorithms (Convolutionnal Neurals Network (CNN), AlexNet, GoogleNet, LeNet, LeNet5) and the transfer learning using a pretrained models (VGG16, MobileNet and RestNet50). We trained and tested our models online using google colaboratory with Tensorflow/Keras and Scikit-Learn libraries that support deep learning and machine learning in Python. The main metric used in our study to evaluate the performance of ML and DL algorithms is the accuracy and matrix confusion. The best result for the ML models is obtained with the use of ANN (88.71%) and for the DL models is obtained for the GoogleNet architecture (93.75%). The results obtained showed that the number of epochs and the depth of the network have an effect in obtaining the best results.},
