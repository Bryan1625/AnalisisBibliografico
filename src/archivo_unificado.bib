 abstract = {Software testing is one of the crucial supporting processes of the software life cycle. Unfortunately for the software industry, the role is stigmatized, partly due to misperception and partly due to treatment of the role. The present study aims to analyse the situation to explore what restricts computer science and software engineering students from taking up a testing career in the software industry. To conduct this study, we surveyed 88 Pakistani students taking computer science or software engineering degrees. The results showed that the present study supports previous work into the unpopularity of testing compared to other software life cycle roles. Furthermore, the findings of our study showed that the role of tester has become a social role, with as many social connotations as technical implications.},

 abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic left a lot of people sick, tired, and frustrated. Many people expressed their feelings on social media through comments and posts. Detecting hate speech on social media is important to help reduce the spread of racist comments. Machine learning algorithms can be used to classify hate speech. In our experiments, we implement semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to classify Twitter data. We used a count vectorizer as the feature and a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify COVID-19 related Twitter data while changing the amount of labeled data available. We found that self-training semi-supervised machine learning has similar effectiveness to supervised learning when there is significantly less training data available.},

 abstract = {The research explores how dermatologists use machine learning to quickly and accurately identify and classify skin injury. Conventional diagnosis techniques depend on visual examination, but are subjective and have different interpretations. The ability to analyze data and recognize patterns is a possible remedy for ML. The paper examines the current technology of machine learning, focusing on validation in the real world, and deals with data set variability. Although the research acknowledges the fruitfulness of deep learning (DL), the research emphasizes the benefits of traditional ML techniques regarding interpretation and processing performance. Methods for automating the analysis of skin lesions, such as feature engineering, rule-based techniques and traditional ML algorithms, have been studied. The study suggests using advanced transfer learning techniques, integrating genetic and clinical data, and refining the way artificial intelligence (AI) is explained in order to get over barriers. Intending to enhance the accessibility and correctness of skin lesion identification, the future requires collaboration between dermatology and machine learning to develop real-time diagnostic tools. By offering scalable solutions for rapid diagnosis of lesions and improved patient outcomes, this combination of medical expertise and ML capabilities has the power to revolutionize dermatology. The future of automated dermatological diagnosis is expected to be shaped by collaboration between machine learning experts and dermatologists, enabling more personalized treatment for patients.},

However, the adoption and effectiveness of AI in healthcare are significantly impacted by patient attitudes. This paper addresses the gap in understanding these attitudes. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the perspectives of diabetic patients on the use of AI applications and tools in diabetes care. This study also examined the patterns of acceptance and understanding of AI among diabetic patients. This study used qualitative methods using in-depth interviews with seventeen Malaysian diabetic patients in Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Klang (HTAR), Malaysia. The interview lasted two weeks, from August 8, 2023, to August 22, 2023. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed word-for-word. The transcribed content was then organized and coded using ATLAS.ti version 8. Thematic analysis was performed in accordance with established guidelines for data analysis. Three key themes emerged from participant interviews regarding the patients' attitudes toward AI application in diabetes care. These themes were perceived acceptability, perceived benefits of using AI tools, and perceived need. The majority of participants expressed their positive view of using AI tools. The findings of this study lay the groundwork for a theoretical framework aimed at understanding patients' stances on AI applications in diabetic care, emphasizing the health, technological, and social experiences that influence their perspectives on AI in this context.},

The correct selection of patients who may undergo same-day discharge (SDD) is a significant challenge due to the large volume of variables that must be considered. This paper proposes a machine-learning approach to predict SDD after angiography procedures. Data from 3227 patients scheduled for angiography procedures, including information about geographical location, demographic characteristics, pre-existing diseases, and clinical procedure type, were used to train and test machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The target was to predict patients with or without same-day discharge after they received an angiography procedure. Performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, learning time, and inference time, were computed for each algorithm. The algorithms with the best performance were LR and SVM, with an F1-score of 0.800 and 0.806, respectively. LR had better behavior than SVM concerning learning and inference time.},

This study explores the application of various machine learning algorithms to CHD data to identify and predict the risk of developing the disease based on health indicators. We employed several algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), each with its unique strengths and limitations. The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 86%, proving effective in binary classification tasks but revealing potential class imbalance issues. The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated robustness with an accuracy of around 85.24%, adeptly handling complex datasets. While specific accuracy metrics for the SVM were not detailed, it was noted for its classification capabilities. The RNN achieved an accuracy of approximately 85.96%, effectively capturing temporal dependencies within the data. Results indicate that although all models performed well, challenges such as class imbalance impacted performance metrics, especially in predicting CHD cases. This highlights the need for further refinement in predictive models to improve precision, recall, and F1-scores. Later research will examine the integration of advanced deep learning methodologies to enhance the precision and dependability of CHD forecasts.},

 abstract = {To solve multi-class problems of support vector machines (SVM) more efficiently, a novel framework, which we call class-incremental learning (CIL), is proposed in this paper. CIL consists of two phases: incremental feature selection and incremental training, for updating the knowledge of old SVM classifiers in text classification when new classes are added to the system. CIL reuses the old models of the classifier and learns only one binary sub-classifier with an additional phase of feature selection when a new class comes. In the testing phase, current classifier is applied to the vectors' projections on the sub-spaces concerned. CIL can serve as a flexible approach for all binary classification algorithms in text classification. Our experiment shows that the CIL-based SVM was not only substantially faster in training time than the popular batch SVM learning methods such as 1-against-rest, 1-against-1 and divide-by-2 but also almost competed to the best performances in effectiveness of them},

 abstract = {The creation of various mobile devices speeded up the development of context-aware computing. Context-aware applications are able to adjust execution policies at any moment according to context information such as equipment's position, electric power, network bandwidth, and so on. In various context-aware systems, an important solution is to isolate executable codes in different context into a number of program segments and to select different execution policies according to the context in the process of operation, thus increasing the programming flexibility. However, the method can result in conflicts, making the system unable to select correct execution policy. This paper proposes a kind of algorithm designed to resolve conflicts. The algorithm calculates the selection center of each policy and the offset value of each conflicting policy under the current context environment. The algorithm will select execution policies through comparing offsets of policies, thus eliminating conflicts. To avoid the problem of policy thrashing resulting from frequent changes of context environment within a small scope, the algorithm modifies the calculate method of offset through the introduction of persistence coefficient. Experiments testify that the algorithm can effectively eliminate conflicts and well manifest the intention of policy definition, making policy selection more reasonable. Meanwhile the algorithm can avoid the thrashing of policy selection, providing more satisfaction to user.},

Our results show that the system infrastructure in the case study would have cost 37% less over 5 years on EC2, and using cloud computing could have potentially eliminated 21% of the support calls for this system. These findings seem significant enough to call for a migration of the system to the cloud but our stakeholder impact analysis revealed that there are significant risks associated with this. Whilst the benefits of using the cloud are attractive, we argue that it is important that enterprise decision-makers consider the overall organizational implications of the changes brought about with cloud computing to avoid implementing local optimizations at the cost of organization-wide performance.},

Applying or at least initiating these techniques at the point and time of sample collection can enhance their effectiveness. To that end, in-situ sample processing and real-time molecular detection schemes have been implemented using deployable autonomous systems that can be operated in diverse ocean environments from shallow coastal waters to the deep sea. Such devices have been termed “ecogenomic sensors.” The size of these instruments currently requires that they be moored in a fixed location or passively mobile, drifting at fixed depth and observing microbial communities in a moving frame of reference with ocean currents. With the highly dynamic motion of open water and microbial life, the next frontier of ocean microbial research requires the improved capability of an actively mobile asset. A mobile ecogenomic sensor encompasses a fully maneuverable vehicle with weeks of persistence, environmental data analysis, detection of physical and biological features, autonomous sampling and in situ analysis, and near-real-time data reporting. This system is now being developed by integrating three components: a compact molecular analytical instrument (the 3rd generation Environmental Sample Processor), a long-range autonomous underwater vehicle, and software algorithms for AUV-based feature detection and sampling. A summary of the system and its initial application is presented.},

However, how to ensure the security of data sharing within a group and how to efficiently share the outsourced data in a group manner are formidable challenges. Note that key agreement protocols have played a very important role in secure and efficient group data sharing in cloud computing. In this paper, by taking advantage of the symmetric balanced incomplete block design (SBIBD), we present a novel block design-based key agreement protocol that supports multiple participants, which can flexibly extend the number of participants in a cloud environment according to the structure of the block design. Based on the proposed group data sharing model, we present general formulas for generating the common conference key $\mathcal {K}$K for multiple participants. Note that by benefiting from the $(v,k + 1,1)$(v,k+1,1)-block design, the computational complexity of the proposed protocol linearly increases with the number of participants and the communication complexity is greatly reduced. In addition, the fault tolerance property of our protocol enables the group data sharing in cloud computing to withstand different key attacks, which is similar to Yi's protocol.},

In addition to the huge number of dedicated servers deployed in data centers, there are billions of underutilized Personal Computers (PCs), usually used only for a few hours per day, owned by individuals and organizations worldwide. The vast untapped compute and storage capacities of the underutilized PCs can be consolidated as alternative cloud fabrics to provision broad cloud services, primarily infrastructure as a service. This approach, thus referred to as "no data center" approach, complements the data center based cloud provision model. In this paper, we present our opportunistic Cloud Computing system, called cuCloud, that runs on scavenged resources of underutilized PCs within an organization/community. Our system demonstrates that the "no data center" solution indeed works. Besides proving our concept, model, and philosophy, our experimental results are highly encouraging.},

 abstract = {Clouds have been increasingly adopted due to primarily their elasticity and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) pricing. While many organizations outsource the entire ICT solution to public clouds like Amazon Web Services Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), others consider occasional workload offloading (cloud bursting) due to various reasons including governance and security. In this paper, we present Cloud Bursting Scheduler (CBS), a new cloud bursting algorithm. CBS explicitly takes into account cost factors of private in-house system (or private cloud) and public cloud. In particular, CBS attempts to optimize the cost to performance ratio by offloading jobs to public cloud explicitly taking into account time-varying electricity rates with private clouds and the timeinvariant rental rate of many public clouds. Based on simulation results obtained using real workload traces, CBS saves costs of running workloads by 55% and 12% compared with costs of cloud sourcing and private cloud, respectively. It also improves resource utilization (to 89%) by judiciously (de)activating inhouse resources and dynamically provisioning cloud resources.},

 abstract = {Whatever one public cloud, private cloud or a mixed cloud, the users lack of effective security quantifiable evaluation methods to grasp the security situation of its own information infrastructure on the whole. This paper provides a quantifiable security evaluation system for different clouds that can be accessed by consistent API. The evaluation system includes security scanning engine, security recovery engine, security quantifiable evaluation model, visual display module and etc. The security evaluation model composes of a set of evaluation elements corresponding different fields, such as computing, storage, network, maintenance, application security and etc. Each element is assigned a three tuple on vulnerabilities, score and repair method. The system adopts “One vote vetoed” mechanism for one field to count its score and adds up the summary as the total score, and to create one security view. We implement the quantifiable evaluation for different cloud users based on our G-Cloud platform. It shows the dynamic security scanning score for one or multiple clouds with visual graphs and guided users to modify configuration, improve operation and repair vulnerabilities, so as to improve the security of their cloud resources.},

Currently, there are multiple solutions available in the market with limited success due to hidden drawbacks, for instance, vendor-lock-in, portability issues in migration, security threats and expensive in the long run and also, unfortunately, interoperability standardization is still work in progress. In this paper, we explore few hybrid/multi cloud use cases and demonstrate how these can be accomplished with our Federated Cloud Services Framework (middleware), which is built upon OpenStack [5], an open source cloud and by leveraging existing OpenStack functionalities.},

The goal of representation learning is to automatically learning good features with deep models. Multimodal representation learning is a special representation learning, which automatically learns good features from multiple modalities, and these modalities are not independent, there are correlations and associations among modalities. Furthermore, multimodal data are usually heterogeneous. Due to the characteristics, multimodal representation learning poses many difficulties: how to combine multimodal data from heterogeneous sources; how to jointly learning features from multimodal data; how to effectively describe the correlations and associations, etc. These difficulties triggered great interest of researchers along with the upsurge of deep learning, many deep multimodal learning methods have been proposed by different researchers. In this paper, we present an overview of deep multimodal learning, especially the approaches proposed within the last decades. We provide potential readers with advances, trends and challenges, which can be very helpful to researchers in the field of machine, especially for the ones engaging in the study of multimodal deep machine learning.},

It is difficult to define the meaning of realistic game experience, but generally speaking, it usually refers to the immersion of the game and the intelligence of non-player characters in the game. As the technical core of improving game playability and the selling point of many commercial games, game artificial intelligence gives players a way to interact with non-player characters in the game, and promotes the realm of game experience to a higher level.

The concept of artificial intelligence is to simulate human intelligence by machine, thus completing specific roles and tasks, and has the characteristics of convenience, intelligence and interaction. It is mainly applied to computer vision, natural language processing, biometric recognition, speech recognition, human-computer interaction and other technologies in the field of education, which brings space for the development of architecture, medicine and chemistry. However, AI also brings about the risk of decisionmaking mistakes, career substitution, privacy leakage, information cocoon house and data bias. In order to avoid these risks effectively, this paper puts forward solutions from five perspectives: the state, product developers, educational managers, teachers and students, so as to correctly understand the relationship between artificial intelligence and education, explore the application mode of artificial intelligence in the field of education, and ensure the deep integration of artificial intelligence and education.},

 abstract = {Digital gait measures derived from wearable inertial sensors have been shown to support the treatment of patients with motor impairments. From a technical perspective, the detection of left and right initial foot contacts (ICs) is essential for the computation of stride-by-stride outcome measures including gait asymmetry. However, in a majority of studies only one sensor close to the center of mass is used, complicating the assignment of detected ICs to the respective foot. Therefore, we developed an algorithm including supervised machine learning (ML) models for the robust classification of left and right ICs using multiple features from the gyroscope located at the lower back. The approach was tested on a data set including 40 participants (ten healthy controls, ten hemiparetic, ten Parkinson’s disease, and ten Huntington’s disease patients) and reached an accuracy of 96.3% for the overall data set and up to 100.0% for the Parkinson’s sub data set. These results were compared to a state-of-the-art algorithm. The ML approaches outperformed this traditional algorithm in all subgroups. Our study contributes to an improved classification of left and right ICs in inertial sensor signals recorded at the lower back and thus enables a reliable computation of clinically relevant mobility measures.},

 abstract = {The encounter of large amounts of biological sequence data generated during the last decades and the algorithmic and hardware improvements have offered the possibility to apply machine learning techniques in bioinformatics. While the machine learning community is aware of the necessity to rigorously distinguish data transformation from data comparison and adopt reasonable combinations thereof, this awareness is often lacking in the field of comparative sequence analysis. With realization of the disadvantages of alignments for sequence comparison, some typical applications use more and more so-called alignment-free approaches. In light of this development, we present a conceptual framework for alignment-free sequence comparison, which highlights the delineation of: 1) the sequence data transformation comprising of adequate mathematical sequence coding and feature generation, from 2) the subsequent (dis-)similarity evaluation of the transformed data by means of problem-specific but mathematically consistent proximity measures. We consider coding to be an information-loss free data transformation in order to get an appropriate representation, whereas feature generation is inevitably information-lossy with the intention to extract just the task-relevant information. This distinction sheds light on the plethora of methods available and assists in identifying suitable methods in machine learning and data analysis to compare the sequences under these premises.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence is one of the most trending topics in the field of Computer Science which aims to make machines and computers ‘smart’. There are multiple diverse technical and specialized research associated with it. Due to the accelerating rate of technological changes, artificial intelligence has taken over a lot of human jobs and is giving excellent results that are more efficient and effective, than humans. However, a lot of time there has been a concern about the following: will artificial intelligence surpass human intelligence in the near future? Are computers' ever accelerating abilities to outpace human jobs and skills a matter of concern? The different views and myths on the subject have made it even a more than just a topic of discussion. In this research paper, we will study the existing facts and literature to understand the true definitions of artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence (HI) by classifying each of its types separately and analyzing the extent of their full capabilities. Later, we will discuss the possibilities if AI eventually can replace human jobs in the market. Finally, we will synthesize and summarize results and findings of why artificial intelligence cannot surpass human intelligence completely in the future.},

CVDs can be diagnosed and prevented early by identifying risk biomarkers using statistical and machine learning (ML) models, In this work, we utilize clinical CVD risk factors and biochemical data using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB), Extreme Grading Boosting (XGB) and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) to predict death caused by CVD within ten years of follow-up. We used the cohort of the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) study and 2943 patients were included in the analysis (484 annotated as dead due to CVD). We calculated the Accuracy (ACC), Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Specificity (SPE) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each model. The findings of the comparative analysis show that Logistic Regression has been proven to be the most reliable algorithm having accuracy 72.20 %. These results will be used in the TIMELY study to estimate the risk score and mortality of CVD in patients with 10-year risk.},

 abstract = {In additive manufacturing (AM), a common problem is the efficient arrangement of arbitrary three-dimensional objects, subject to geometric constraints. This can be mapped to three-dimensional irregular packing (3DIP) problems, which have been systematically addressed by many academics and practitioners. This study demonstrates the utilisation of machine learning for algorithm selection to find efficient layout configurations during the design stage of the AM process. The choice of the most suitable approach to use, typically a packing algorithm, is not trivial, and depends on the non-obvious relationship between the characteristics of the instance in hand and the portfolio of algorithms available. The matching between problem features and algorithm performance forms the basis of the well-known algorithm selection problem. This study introduces the first empirical investigation of algorithm selection for 3DIP problems, conducting extensive experiments with hundreds of combinations of well-known supervised machine learning classifiers and different parameter settings to identify an initial state-of-the-art for this problem. We generate a comprehensive dataset, labelled with the performance of two of the most popular 3DIP algorithms, and analyse the features which can be used to support decision making when selecting a method to solve a 3DIP instance. Our results show that deploying machine learning-based algorithm selection methods are able to outperform the results obtained by the individual constituent packing algorithms applied independently, with the best algorithm selection method obtaining a 1.48% higher average build volume utilisation over the 2000 problem instances tested.},

 abstract = {This study aimed to apply the algorithmic trading strategy on major foreign exchange pairs and compare the performances of machine learning-based and traditional momentum strategies with benchmark strategies. It differs from other studies in that it considered various cases, including different foreign exchange pairs, return methods, data frequency, and individual and integrated trading strategies. Ridge regression, KNN, RF, XGBoost, GBDT, ANN, LSTM, and GRU models were used for the machine learning-based strategy, while the MA cross strategy was employed for the momentum strategy. Backtests were performed on six major pairs from January 1, 2000, to June 30, 2023, and daily and intraday data were used. The Sharpe ratio was considered as a metric used to refer to economic significance and the independent t-test was used to determine statistical significance. The general findings of the study suggested that the currency market has become more efficient. The rise in efficiency is probably caused by the fact that more algorithms are being used in this market, and information spreads much faster. Instead of finding a trading strategy that works well in all major foreign exchange pairs, our study showed that it is possible to find an effective algorithmic trading strategy that generates a more effective trading signal in each specific case.},
